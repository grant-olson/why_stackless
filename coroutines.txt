The Problem with to Subroutines
-------------------------------

Most conventional programming languages expose the concept of subroutines.  A
subroutine is called by another routine (which is probably considered a
subroutine by another routine) and may or may not return a result.  By
definition, a subroutine is subordinate to the caller. 

Take the following example:

.. include:: code\\pingpong.py
   :literal:

An experienced programmer will see a problem with this program.  It causes a
stack overflow.  If you run the program, it'll display a big nasty traceback
indicating that you ran out of stack space.

The Stack
=========

I debated how much detail I should get into about the C-stack, and decided to
bypass the description entirely.  It seemed like other attempts to describe it
and diagrams only made sense to people who already understood it.  I'll try to
provide a simplistic explanation of it.  Interested readers should look for
more information on the web.

Every time you call a subroutine, it creates a **stack frame**.  This is the
holding area for variables and other information local to the subroutine.  In
this case, when you call *ping()* it creates a stack frame that holds
information for the subroutine call.  Simplistically, the frame says that says
*ping pinged*.  When it calls *pong()*, this creates another stack frame that
says *pong ponged*.  The stack frames are chained together, with each
subroutine call acting as a link in the chain.  In this case, the stack
basically says *ping pinged so pong ponged*.  Of course when *pong()* calls
*ping()* this extends the stack.  Here is a visual representation:

===== ===========================================================================
Frame Stack
===== ===========================================================================
 1    ping pinged
 2    ping pinged so pong ponged
 3    ping pinged so pong ponged so ping pinged
 4    ping pinged so pong ponged so ping pinged so pong ponged
 5    ping pinged so pong ponged so ping pinged so pong ponged so ping pinged
 6    ping pinged so pong ponged so ping pinged so pong ponged so ping pinged ...
===== ===========================================================================

Now imagine that the page width represents the memory that your system has
allocated to the stack.  When you hit the edge of the page, you *overflow* and
the system runs out of memory.  Hence the term *stack overflow*.

So why do we use stacks?
========================

The above example is intentionally designed to show you the problem with the
stack.  In most cases, each stack frame cleans itself up when a subroutine
returns.  In those cases, the stack will clean itself up.  This is generally a
good thing.  In C, the stack is the one area where the programmer doesn't have
to do manual memory management.  Luckily, python programmers don't have to
worry about memory management and the stack directly, but because the python
interpreter itself is written in C, the implementors do have to worry about it.
Using the stack makes things convenient.  That is until we start calling
functions that never return, like the example above.  Then the stack actually
starts working against the programmer, and exhausts available memory.

----------------
Enter Coroutines
----------------

In this case, it's a little silly that the stack overflows.  *ping()* and
*pong()* aren't really subroutines.  One isn't subordinate to the other.  They
are *coroutines*, on equal footing, who should be able communicate seamlessly
with each other.

===== ===========================================================================
Frame Stack
===== ===========================================================================
 1    ping pinged
 2    pong ponged
 3    ping pinged
 4    pong ponged
 5    ping pinged
 6    pong ponged
===== ===========================================================================

With stackless, we create coroutines with channels.  If you remember, one of
the two benefits of channels is that they allow you to control flow between
tasklets.  By using channels, we can go back and forth between the ping and
pong tasklets as much as we want without a stack overflow:

.. include:: code\\pingpong_stackless.py
   :literal:

You can run this program as long as you want and it won't crash.  Also, if you
examine memory usage (with the Task Manager on Windows or **top** on Unix),
you'll see that memory usage is constant.  The coroutine version of the program
uses the same memory whether it runs for 1 minute or a day.  If you examine
memory usage of the recursive version, you'll see that it grows quickly before
the program blows up.

Summary
-------

If you recall, earlier I mentioned that experience programmers would
immediately see a problem with the recursive version of the code.  But
honestly, there's not 'computer science' issue that would prevent this code
from working.  It is simply a minor implementation detail that you're stuck with
in most conventional languages, because most conventional languages use a
stack.  In some sense, experienced programmers have simply been brainwashed to
accept this as an acceptable problem.  Stackless removes this perceived
problem.
